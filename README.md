# Spotify Analytics Insight: What Makes a Song Popular?

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Spotify song data to uncover patterns behind music popularity using the Spotify Wrapped 2025 dataset.

The objective is to understand how audio features such as **danceability, energy, tempo (BPM), and valence** influence a song’s streaming performance.

By building a structured data analytics pipeline, the project transforms raw data into meaningful insights and visualizations that explain what drives high-performing songs.

## Business Question

**What makes a song successful on Spotify?**

This project answers this by analyzing how musical attributes and metadata impact streaming performance.

---

## Key Insights

- Songs with higher **energy and danceability** tend to achieve more streams  
- **Explicit songs** show slightly higher average streaming performance  
- Certain **BPM ranges (100–130)** dominate high-performing tracks  
- **Valence (happiness)** has a moderate positive relationship with streams  
- Popular songs are heavily concentrated in mainstream genres  

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- End-to-end **data analytics workflow**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (**EDA**)
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib**
- Extracting actionable insights from real-world datasets
- Writing clean, modular, and reproducible Python code

# Sample Visualizations

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

### BPM vs Streams
![BPM vs Streams](visuals/bpm_vs_streams.png)

_Mid-tempo songs tend to achieve higher streaming performance, suggesting an optimal BPM range for mainstream appeal._


### Explicit vs Clean Songs
![Explicit vs Streams](visuals/explicit_vs_streams.png)

_Explicit songs show slightly higher average streams, indicating a potential listener preference for unfiltered or expressive content._


### Genre Distribution
![Genre Distribution](visuals/genre_distribution.png)

_A few dominant genres account for most top-performing songs, highlighting the concentration of popularity within specific music categories._


### Valence vs Streams
![Valence vs Streams](visuals/valence_vs_streams.png)

_No strong correlation observed — both high and low valence songs can achieve high streaming performance._

---
## Key Takeaways

- Popularity is driven by a combination of features, not a single factor. 
- Mid-range BPM and higher energy levels tend to perform better  
- Explicit content may influence listener engagement  
- Emotional tone (valence) alone is not a strong predictor of success

---
## Dataset

**Spotify Wrapped 2025 Top Songs & Artists (Kaggle)**

Includes:
- Song metadata
- Audio features (BPM, energy, danceability, valence)
- Streaming performance metrics

---
## Analysis Questions Explored

1. What BPM range produces the most streamed songs?
2. Do explicit songs perform better than clean songs?
3. How does valence (happiness) affect streams?
4. Which genres dominate top-performing songs?
5. What audio features define high-performing tracks?
